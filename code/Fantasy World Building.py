background = '''Valeria used to be a human girl, with a Fae mother and human father. But she was born with a curse that any
living thing she touches will corrode and die. She eventually learned to control it, but by then the damage had already been done, and her village shunned her.
Her family was slaughtered and she was forcibly taken by an evil ruler named Morgarath, and used as the Queen's Champion
for centuries. After four centuries in the Nightmare Palace, she was rescued and is slowly learning to not only heal, but how to trust and love herself as well as others.'''
backgroun = '''She along with Maximus---a Fae male who is the extremely powerful Sovereign of the Celestial Court and was also
used and scarred by Morgarath---must go on a journey to help each other heal, and perhaps even save the world. Only by pushing past their horizons and
testing unknown waters, can they find the courage to heal from the trauma that they both endured under the same nightmare.'''
deity = '''Her body is being inhabited by an extremely old deity who is unable to take physical form in the Fae world, so it uses
her as a conduit. There is a strange mark on her arm. Circular, ancient, and thickly ringed with a void purple color—a color so dark it was nearly black, but laced with shifting undertones of deep amethyst, indigo, and a strange, oily shimmer that sometimes looked like stars trapped beneath the surface.
It felt like a color you could fall into—bottomless, cold, and pulsing with slow, alien energy. 
At the very center of the brand, there was a pale outline of a flame. It looked empty for now but I caught hints of silver, purple, and black waiting along edges to fill it in.
The flame was surrounded by a pentagon, and there was a symbol on each of its points, but they were faint, as if they had yet to show their color.
At the tip of the pentagon, there was a compass starburst surrounded with orbital rings around it.
To its right, there was a rune shaped like a fang with flames curling off of it.
Then an inverted spiral wave, then a circular seed pod cracked open with vines snaking out of it, and finally, ending at the left of the compass,
there was a jagged glyph with twin lightning bolts crossing to create an X.
All these symbols were connected with a thin silver line.   
With her time running out, and the deity gaining power by the day, Valeria and Maximus have finally found and retrieved the Crown.
It is an ancient magical item that has the power to cleanse the deity of her body and soul, but at a price...
She is given a choice:
Binding the deity with the Crown will kill her, and all the ones she loves
Merging with the Crown and the deity will give it unlimited power and may destroy the world
Attempting to forge a different path may condemn them all

curse = '''This is the story of how the fallen one plunges even further.
Slowly, over centuries, she breaks.
Surely, with each cruel turn, she bends.
Painfully, she loses faith in the light.
And even when nothing remains to take, she endures.
But tell me—can a fallen angel ever find her wings again?

Time ticks away on the wings of magic.
Choose, cursed one.
Bind, and you shall fall with all you love.
Merge, and the world shall burn in your image.
Defy, and doom them all.

Only when the shuttered doors are thrust open again,
And the dry spring fills with rich life once more.
Not for power, nor penance, nor pain
But for balance long denied.

"Break me, and use my power to destroy Dravyn within you, banishing it from this world entirely---or at least for many more eons.
But in doing so, the immense power of the dying entity will claim not only your life, but Maximus's as well. Would you be willing to take that from him to save the world?
Bind with Dravyn, and you will become it. Your soul and body will be consumed, yet a small part of your consciousness will remain.
The world as you know it will be demolished, and its people killed or enslaved. But Maximus and you will be safe, just fused into the body of Dravyn.
Choose, Valeria Xilliana — the world, or the only soul who dared to mend your bitter, shattered heart when all others turned away.

He is the only reason I breathe. The only reason I love. He’s the only reason I endure this miserable existence I never wanted, but can’t escape.”
I can't lose him," my voice broke as I made my decision. We were apostraphes, inverted and upside down, caught between two worlds in a life we never asked for. So small, yet without us, the worlds would collapse.
    The Crown's voice projected into my head. "You would let the world burn for a chance at saving your lover and yourself. Why?"
    "You want to know why?" I said, my heart growing steely hard. "All this world has ever done for me is break me, over and over, and kick me and shove me down whenever I tried to get back up.
You ask why I would choose a single soul over millions. Because he's the only one that ever cared about me. He's the only one who helped me back up when I had lost all hope.
I would burn the world if it meant saving him, and that's exactly what I'm doing. I've always been the one who gave and gave without limit. I sacrificed everything---my mind, my body, my soul, my heart, my life.
And when it had taken every single thing that ever mattered to me, it gave me Maximus. I was so afraid to love him, to let him in, because I knew he would be taken away too.
But I couldn't help myself, and in doing so, I condemned us both. Anything I touch dies. He isn't anything different, but I would save him every time, because he stayed when nobody else did.
So I'm sorry to all the lives I chose Maximus over. But I'm not sorry for finally taking something for myself. Through Maximus, I have learned that I don't need to bleed to fix things, and that it's ok to love myself.
The Fae entity within me only understands sacrifice and devotion through loss, and I used to be that way, but Maximus came along and I fell in love and now I have something to live for.
Dying for something is noble and heroical, but living for someone? That's the ultimate sacrifice. Changing yourself in ways you never would've without the other person sacrifices more than you would think.
Life was actually looking better for the first time in centuries, but of course, I can't have that, so I'll take the next best thing. Living out the rest of my days in the body of Dravyn, but at least I'll be with Maximus.
I'm sorry it ended this way, both for me and the world, but sometimes, you don't get to live the life of happily ever after, even if you are the hero."''')

I have spent my whole life choosing my happiness, or someone else's. I don't have to bleed to make things better, and it's not always my fault.
Maximus has shown me that I am worth it and I am enough just the way I am. I'll find a way to save Maximus and the world, even if it comes at the cost of just myself.
