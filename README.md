Passion project
A story-driven app exploring trust, emotion, and personal growth.
Built using code, psychology, and storytelling.


#Plan so far 
8th grade 
**Goal: Explore ideas, start coding**
Writing / Creative:
Start writing the story beginning at where Valeria is just starting her five trials
Explore ways to make the text more readable 

Coding / STEM:
Start coding with the storyline involved. Find more efficient ways to do things to make code shorter and easier to read.
Can keep what I have now and add onto it as I learn more. Split into chapters. Chapter 1 has trial of spirit, chapter 2 trial of will, and so on.


Supporting Activities:
Journaling ideas and reflections.
Join coding or writing clubs.
Track progress for future essays/portfolio.
